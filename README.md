Author: Sonia Cobo Pacios 
Title: Generating Music with Artificial Intelligence
Summary: This project's aim is to generate a melody from MIDI files considering differente types of neural networks in Python using the Keras library. 
The chosen neural networks are two Long short-term memory (LSTM) models (a Bidirectional and a Unidirectional network) and a Generative adversarial network (GAN) considering different layers and parameters.
These neural networks are then compared to determine which one has generated the 'best' melody.
