    "project_description": "This project's aim is to generate new melodies from MIDI files considering \
    differente types of neural networks. \
    The chosen neural networks are two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models (a Bidirectional and \
    a Unidirectional network) and a Generative adversarial network (GAN) considering different layers and parameters. \
    These neural networks are then compared to determine which one has generated the 'best' melody.",
